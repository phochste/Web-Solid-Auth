# INSTALL

## libmagic library 

For mime type guessing we need the `libmagic` library.

On Debian/Ubuntu run:

```
sudo apt-get install libmagic-dev
```

On Red Hat run:

```
sudo yum install file-devel
```

On Mac you can use homebrew (https://brew.sh/):

```
brew install libmagic
```

## CPANM

CPANM is the Perl package manager

On Debian/Ubuntu run:

```
sudo apt-get apt-get install cpanminus
```

On Red Hat run:

```
sudo  yum install perl-App-cpanminus 
```

On Mac you can use homebrew:

```
brew install cpanminus
```

## Install this package from the official release

Run

```
cpanm Web::Solid::Auth
```

Add your favorite Solid Pod to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` (depending on your shell)

```
# Your WebId
export SOLID_WEBID=https://hochstenbach.inrupt.net/profile/card#me
# The baseUrl used for relative urls (without the slash at the end!)
export SOLID_REMOTE_BASE=https://hochstenbach.inrupt.net
```

Reread your shell configuratation file:

```
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Hello World

Authenticate to your own pod. The program below will ask you to open a link
in a webbrowser and authenticate at your identity provider (IDP). When you
are authenticated you can close the program

```
solid_auth.pl authenticate
```

Now you can check private data

```
# List the root container
solid_auth.pl list /
```

## PLENV

If you happen to happen to run [plenv](https://github.com/tokuhirom/plenv) , a Perl binary manager, don't forget to run `plenv rehash` after you ran `cpanm`. This
will put the `solid_auth.pl` script in your path.
